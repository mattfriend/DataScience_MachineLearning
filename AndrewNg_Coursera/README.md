This folder contains Jupyter notebooks containing my solutions, notes and code for the various programming exercises in Andrew Ng's famous Machine Learning course on Coursera.

The course asks you to complete the programming exercises in MATLAB or OCTAVE programming languages; however it's possible to complete them in Python and still submit to the course's website, thanks to various programmers who have kindly created scripts to do just that.

More details and links can be found in these notebooks.
