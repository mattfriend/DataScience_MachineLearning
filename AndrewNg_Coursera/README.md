This folder contains Jupyter notebooks containing my solutions, notes and code for the various programming exercises in Andrew Ng's famous Machine Learning course on Coursera. These are not meant to be tutorials, or definitive "answers" to the exercises - they are just my notebooks.

The course asks you to complete the programming exercises in MATLAB or OCTAVE programming languages; however it's possible to complete them in Python and still submit to the course's website, thanks to various programmers who have kindly created scripts to do just that. More details and links can be found in these notebooks.

Note that I have not uploaded the data required for the exercises, or the various utility scripts that will allow you to submit Python code to the course - these can be found in the links in the notebooks.
